# Oceanic : Minecraft Aqua
#### Will you accept the challenge of surviving in the ocean ?

In this plugin, you can choose between surviving in the ocean or play Minecraft like every other player.

## Choosing your team
You can choose your team after your death or when you join a server for the first time.

If you don't have any bed spawn defined, you'll be teleported randomly between 20,000 and 50,000 from the world spawn.

## The breathing mechanic
The breathing duration outside the water is the same as a normal player in the water, 300 ticks.

Having the enchantment **Respiration** grants you **15 seconds** per level.

Having the **Water Breathing** effect allows you to breath outside the water while the effect is active.

You can also use a **Cauldron** to breath (using a trapdoor to be in a swimming position).

## 1 minute rush
When you choose the Aquatic team, you'll be granted 1 minute of Water Breathing to get enough time to find water (or to grab some wood and food). 

Greed at your own risks !

## Water Breathing Looting
You have multiple ways to loot a Water Breathing Potion

- **Opening a looting chest (structure)** 
    - 1 chance out of 2 to get a **45 seconds** potion.
- **Fishing**
    - 1 chance out of 10 to get a potion, duration being enchant dependent but with the same probabilities
        - **No enchant** : 45s
        - **Luck of the Sea I** : 45s or 1m30s
        - **Luck of the Sea II** : 45s or 1m30s or 3m
        - **Luck of the Sea III** : 45s or 1m30 or 3m or 8m

## Requirement
This plugin has been tested on **Minecraft 1.15.2** but should be compatible with **Minecraft 1.13+**.
**Note :** No other plugin were installed during tests. If you find any incompatibilty, please open an issue !

## Original Idea
The idea come from a datapack created by @Roark_Cats (Twitter) played by WadZee (YouTube). I liked the idea and decided to code it as a plugin !
