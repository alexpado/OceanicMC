# Oceanic : Minecraft Aqua
#### Will you accept the challenge of surviving in the ocean ?

In this plugin, you can choose between surviving in the ocean or play Minecraft like every other player.

## The aquatic life
You want to visit the lands ? If you drink a **Water Breathing Potion**, you'll be able to breath in the air, just like
you can breath in the water as a normal player. If you don't have any potion, don't worry, you can always take benefits
of the **Respiration Enchant** which give you 15 additional seconds per level.

You also have 1 chance out of 11 to get a **45 seconds Water Breathing Potion** when opening a loot chest. You don't have
anymore excuse to not retrieve wood !

## Requirement
This plugin has been tested on **Minecraft 1.15.2** but should be compatible with **Minecraft 1.13+**.
